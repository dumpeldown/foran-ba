  abstract = {The Open RAN architecture is a promising and future-oriented architecture. It is intended to open up the radio access network (RAN) and enable more innovation and competition in the market. This will lead to RANs for current 5G networks, but especially for future 6G networks, evolving from the current highly integrated, vendor-specific RAN architecture towards disaggregated architectures with open interfaces that will enable to better tailor RAN solutions to the requirements of 5G and 6G applications. However, the introduction of such an open architecture substantially broadens the attack possibilities when compared to conventional RANs. In the past, this has often led to negative headlines that in summary have associated Open RAN with faulty or inadequate security. In this paper, we analyze what components are involved in an Open RAN deployment, how to assess the current state of security, and what measures need to be taken to ensure secure operation.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the security implications of virtualized and software-based Open Radio Access Network (RAN) systems, specifically focusing on the architecture proposed by the O-RAN ALLIANCE and O-Cloud deployments based on the O-RAN Software Community (OSC) stack and infrastructure. Our key findings are based on a thorough security assessment and static scanning of the OSC Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) cluster. We highlight the presence of potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the Kubernetes infrastructure supporting the RIC, also due to the usage of outdated versions of software packages, and provide an estimation of their criticality using various deployment auditing frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT\&CK and the NSA CISA). In addition, we propose methodologies to minimize these issues and harden the Open RAN virtualization infrastructure. These encompass the integration of security evaluation methods into the deployment process, implementing deployment hardening measures, and employing policy-based control for RAN components. We emphasize the need to address the problems found in order to improve the overall security of virtualized Open RAN systems.},

Several groups and companies including the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) and the O-RAN Alliance work on concepts for Open RAN comprising architectures and open interfaces as well as reference implementations, testbeds, and operational installations in mobile network operator (MNO) networks. The O-RAN Software Community (SC) creates a reference implementation of an Open RAN. In this paper, initially vulnerabilities and threats of the O-RAN SC reference implementation are analyzed and secondly an architecture and implementation for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) is discussed, which can be adapted to usual Open RAN implementations.},
