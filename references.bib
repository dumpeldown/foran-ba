  abstract = {In order to meet the stringent latency and reliability requirements of the upcoming 5G networks, Open Radio Access Networks (O-RAN) has been proposed. The virtualization of O-RAN has allowed it to be treated as a Network Function Virtualization (NFV) architecture, while its components are considered Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs). Hence, intelligent Machine Learning (ML) based solutions can be utilized to apply different resource management and allocation techniques on O-RAN. However, intelligently allocating resources for O-RAN VNFs can prove challenging due to the dynamicity of traffic in mobile networks. Network providers need to dynamically scale the allocated resources in response to the incoming traffic. Elastically allocating resources can provide a higher level of flexibility in the network in addition to reducing the OPerational EXpenditure (OPEX) and increasing the resources utilization. Most of the existing elastic solutions are reactive in nature, despite the fact that proactive approaches are more agile since they scale instances ahead of time by predicting the incoming traffic. In this work, we propose and evaluate a traffic forecasting based dynamic scaling scheme using ML. The algorithms aim at predicting future O-RAN traffic by using previous traffic data, then utilize the prediction in coming up with a scaling decision. Detailed analysis of the traffic data was carried out to validate the quality and applicability of the traffic dataset. Hence, two ML models were proposed and evaluated based on their prediction capabilities for traffic forecasting, and three ML models were proposed and evaluated based on their ability to infer the traffic prediction to a the optimal number of O-RAN VNFs.},

  abstract = {This review aims to analyze the recent literature to find how the preattentive visual process is currently used in information visualization, particularly to improve the cognitive process in chart comprehension (i.e., perceptual effectiveness). The purpose of our literature review is to provide an overview of how concepts related to the preattentive process are used pragmatically in recent research. We searched different bibliography sources between 2010 and 2021, getting 29 articles that fit the review focus. In general, we discovered that the research work on exploiting the preattentive process in information visualization is currently not thoroughly explored. The main contribution of the paper is the analysis of the papers, from which we identified two categories of research directions according to the primary uses of preattentive concepts: “preattentive attributes as design components,” and “the preattentive process as a measuring tool,” with a gap between these two approaches. The review also highlighted two limitations in the current research literature: most works tend to focus on a particular chart type, only, with difficult to generalize results, and the manipulation of preattentive attributes is done implicitly, without providing to the graph designer the suitable awareness over the design decisions impact. We finally present a proposal about how to use the knowledge about the preattentive process in the first stages of design in information visualization to start closing the gap mentioned above with the graph designer.}

  abstract = {Categorical perception (CP) of color is the faster and/or more accurate discrimination of colors from different categories than equivalently spaced colors from the same category. Here, we investigate whether color CP at early stages of chromatic processing is independent of top–down modulation from attention. A visual oddball task was employed where frequent and infrequent colored stimuli were either same- or different-category, with chromatic differences equated across conditions. Stimuli were presented peripheral to a central distractor task to elicit an event-related potential (ERP) known as the visual mismatch negativity (vMMN). The vMMN is an index of automatic and pre-attentive visual change detection arising from generating loci in visual cortices. The results revealed a greater vMMN for different-category than same-category change detection when stimuli appeared in the lower visual field, and an absence of attention-related ERP components. The findings provide the first clear evidence for an automatic and pre-attentive categorical code for color.},

  abstract = {The U.S. confrontation with China in technology has been escalating. One of the triggers is China's rise in 5G standardization and its lead in the telecommunications equipment market, which causes security concerns. In response, the U.S. promotes Open RAN as an alternative to the Chinese providers' proprietary solutions. It is claimed to enable the establishment and operation of open and safer networks for 5G and beyond. This paper examines why and how the U.S. promotes Open RAN and what the responses are from other countries. We find that the U.S. government's strong support for the development and dissemination of Open RAN signals its techno-nationalistic turn in international standardization. The origin of Open RAN is geopolitical in the sense that it represents a reaction to China's lead in 5G standardization. The geopolitical perspective is strengthened as we find the formation of alliances in support of Open RAN. A refreshed approach of the U.S. to standardization has introduced a new dynamic to cooperation and competition for setting the global rules on next-generation mobile communication technologies as well as emerging technologies. Standards are increasingly at the core of the ongoing geopolitical technology competition, and as such further investigation is required.},

  abstract = {The Open RAN architecture is a promising and future-oriented architecture. It is intended to open up the radio access network (RAN) and enable more innovation and competition in the market. This will lead to RANs for current 5G networks, but especially for future 6G networks, evolving from the current highly integrated, vendor-specific RAN architecture towards disaggregated architectures with open interfaces that will enable to better tailor RAN solutions to the requirements of 5G and 6G applications. However, the introduction of such an open architecture substantially broadens the attack possibilities when compared to conventional RANs. In the past, this has often led to negative headlines that in summary have associated Open RAN with faulty or inadequate security. In this paper, we analyze what components are involved in an Open RAN deployment, how to assess the current state of security, and what measures need to be taken to ensure secure operation.},

Our key findings are based on a thorough security assessment and static scanning of the OSC Near Real-Time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) cluster. We highlight the presence of potential vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in the Kubernetes infrastructure supporting the RIC, also due to the usage of outdated versions of software packages, and provide an estimation of their criticality using various deployment auditing frameworks (e.g., MITRE ATT\&CK and the NSA CISA). In addition, we propose methodologies to minimize these issues and harden the Open RAN virtualization infrastructure. These encompass the integration of security evaluation methods into the deployment process, implementing deployment hardening measures, and employing policy-based control for RAN components. We emphasize the need to address the problems found in order to improve the overall security of virtualized Open RAN systems.},

  abstract = {The wide and rapid adoption of Android-based devices in the last years has motivated the usage of Android apps to support a broad range of daily activities. In that sense, being the most popular mobile platform makes it an attractive target for security attacks. In fact, 1,489 security vulnerabilities have been reported in the last three years (2015-2017) for the Android OS (which is the underlying platform for Android-based devices). While there is a plethora of approaches and tools for detecting malware and security issues in Android apps, few research has been done to identify, categorize, or detect vulnerabilities in the Android OS. In this paper we present the largest study so far aimed at analyzing software vulnerabilities in the Android OS. In particular, we analyzed a total of 1,235 vulnerabilities from four different perspectives: vulnerability types and their evolution, CVSS vectors that describe the vulnerabilities, impacted Android OS layers, and their survivability across the Android OS history. Based on our findings, we propose a list of future actions that could be performed by researchers and practitioners to reduce the number of vulnerabilities in the Android OS as well as their impact and survivability.}

  abstract = {Business intelligence systems provide information dashboards that aim to assist decision-makers in understanding business situations and consequently support in decision-making. They typically include compressed visual information to raise data exploration from different perspectives. Although information visualization is known as a possible solution to overcome human cognitive limitations such as attention and working memory, we do not know much about existing cognitive challenges of users when performing data exploration tasks using information dashboards. In this paper, we present the results of an eye-tracking experiment to study the impact of attention and working memory limitations on the effectiveness of dashboards. For that, we explicitly considered visuospatial working memory capacity (WMC) as one critical individual difference and investigated how users with different visuospatial WMC allocate attentional resources while conducting data exploration task. We found that both users with high and low visuospatial WMC have difficulties to control their attentional resources. However, these difficulties are more for users with low visuospatial WMC in compare with high WMC. Our results highlighted the need for designing user-adaptive information dashboards. Therefore, we articulated meta-requirements for designing information dashboards that are sensitive to the attention and WMC of their users as two central components of information processing theory.},

  abstract = {For years a strong trend towards cloudification in the mobile communication industry as well as in all other IT-centric operation areas is observed. Several groups and companies including the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) and the O-RAN Alliance work on concepts for Open RAN comprising architectures and open interfaces as well as reference implementations, testbeds, and operational installations in mobile network operator (MNO) networks. The O-RAN Software Community (SC) creates a reference implementation of an Open RAN. In this paper, initially vulnerabilities and threats of the O-RAN SC reference implementation are analyzed and secondly an architecture and implementation for Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) is discussed, which can be adapted to usual Open RAN implementations.},

  abstract = {The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a major vulnerability database that is free to use for everyone. It provides information about vulnerabilities and further useful resources such as linked advisories and patches. The NVD is often considered as the central source for vulnerability information and as a help to improve the resource-intensive process of vulnerability management. Although the NVD receives much public attention, little is known about its usage in vulnerability management, users’ attitudes toward it and whether they encounter any problems during usage. We explored these questions using a preliminary interview study with seven people, and a follow-up survey with 71 participants. The results show that the NVD is consulted regularly and often aids decision making. Generally, users are positive about the NVD and perceive it as a helpful, clearly structured tool. But users also faced issues: missing or incorrect entries, incomplete descriptions or incomprehensible CVSS ratings. In order to identify the problems origins, we discussed the results with two senior NVD members. Many of the problems can be attributed to higher-level problems such as the CVE List or limited resources. Nevertheless, the NVD is working on improving existing problems.},
