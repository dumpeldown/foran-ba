The dashboard developed in this work was specifically designed for use in \gls{dfir} environments for \gls{open-ran}, supporting penetration testing scenarios and enabling precise vulnerability assessments. The integration of the empirical \gls{acema} method and the use of \gls{cvss} data facilitate detailed analyses and visualizations. The dashboard provides a tool for visualizing and analyzing vulnerabilities in the highly virtualized Open RAN environment. Empirical evidence demonstrates which attack techniques pose significant risks or offer higher potential from an attacker{â€™}s perspective. The same findings were achieved in relation to O-RAN, where empirical and statistical methods identified components vulnerable to specific techniques. This work makes a significant contribution to security research while offering practical approaches for future developments and investigations in \gls{dfir} contexts.
